                                <p>Moldova - officially the Republic of Moldova, is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Romania to the 

west and Ukraine to the north, east, and south (by way of the disputed territory of Transnistria). The capital city 

is Chișinău.

Most of the Moldovan territory was a part of the Principality of Moldavia from the 14th century until 1812, when it 

was ceded to the Russian Empire by the Ottoman Empire (to which Moldavia was a vassal state) and became known as 

Bessarabia. In 1856, southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia, which three years later united with Wallachia to 

form Romania, but Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878. During the 1917 Russian Revolution, 

Bessarabia briefly became an autonomous and then independent Moldavian Democratic Republic until it was integrated 

into Romania in 1918 following a vote of its assembly. The decision was disputed by Soviet Russia, which, in 1924, 

allowed the establishment, within the Ukrainian SSR, of a Moldavian autonomous republic (MASSR) on partial Moldovan-

inhabited territories to the east of the Dniester. In 1940, as a consequence of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Romania 

was compelled to cede Bessarabia to the Soviet Union, leading to the creation of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist 

Republic (Moldavian SSR), which included the greater part of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former 

MASSR.

On 27 August 1991, as the dissolution of the Soviet Union was underway, the Moldavian SSR declared independence and 

took the name Moldova. The current Constitution of Moldova was adopted in 1994. The strip of the Moldovan territory 

on the east bank of the Dniester river has been under the de facto control of the breakaway government of 

Transnistria since 1990.

Due to a decrease in industrial and agricultural output following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the service 

sector has grown to dominate Moldova's economy and currently composes over 60% of the nation's GDP. Its economy is 

the poorest in Europe in per capita terms, and has the lowest Human Development Index in the continent, being the 

only country ranked as "medium". Moldova is also the least visited country in Europe by tourists, with only 11,000 

annually recorded visitors from abroad.

Moldova is a parliamentary republic with a president as head of state and a prime minister as head of government. It 

is a member state of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Organization 

for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development, the 

Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) and 

aspires to join the European Union.</p>

                                        </header>
                                        <p>Moldova is a small and uniquely charming country, tucked away between Romania and Ukraine in the furthest reaches of Eastern Europe. On the map it looks like a bunch of ripe grapes, which is no coincidence: Moldova has the highest percentage of land dedicated to vineyards in the world. Looking for more than just magnets to take home from your trip? As one of the least visited countries in the world, Moldova will surprise and intrigue you at every turn, leaving you with unforgettable memories and unique stories to tell your friends.
And while it’s not visited often, all roads lead to Moldova. Fly to the capital, Chisinau, drive or jump on a train from one of our neighbors, or even take a ferry to our southern port on the Danube river.</p>
                                        <p>Moldovan hospitality

It’s the people that make Moldova special! Travel to any corner of Moldova and you will find genuine, friendly interactions with warm and open people. When you arrive in a Moldovan village, before you know it you will be at a table groaning with food, and with the host treating you to local wine. Our national cuisine will surprise you with its honesty, simplicity and richness. Close your eyes and dream of a savory soup called Zeamă, cooked with homemade noodles, and Mămăliga - a dish made from cornmeal - which is cut with a thread and served with Moldovan cheese, sour cream and a meat stew, Tocană.</p>
                                        <p>Our special pies, Plăcintele, are prepared from a thin, flaky pastry with a variety of fillings: cabbage, cottage cheese, apple, pumpkin or cherry – the choice is yours! Is your mouth watering yet? If you’re not overwhelmed by the warmth of our people, then it’s our food that will win your heart.
Wine, wine and more wine!</p>
                                        <p>Wine is the pride of the Moldovan people and it’s what makes this country truly special! Every year, in October, we celebrate National Wine Day in our capital’s central square. How many countries have a national holiday dedicated just to wine? Our best winemakers welcome thousands of guests and surprise them with the incredible

variety and quality of their wines. The sheer scale of National Wine Day is hard to imagine – with 150,000 visitors and more than 1000 types of wine to try, it’s easy to lose count! Dancing, socializing and savoring national dishes creates a special atmosphere, but why not venture outside the festival and visit our hundreds of vineyards and wineries? Taste your way around Moldova, trying our historic local grape varieties and award-winning blends. Or is it wine history that you want? Come and see our special wine cellars, tens of kilometers long, and or a collection of millions of bottles of wine. Some of these cellars are included in the Guinness World Records. You might be wondering how we can fit so many wonders into such a small country!</p>
                                        <p>Diversity
Each corner of Moldova has its own unique identity. In the south, you can find the Găgăuz, a lively people with their own culture, history, traditions, and of course, delicious cuisine. Travel just an hour from Chisinau in another direction and you will discover just how diverse our small country can be. If you cross the Dniester River to its left bank, you will find Transnistria, a territory where time has stood still. Visiting Transnistria can feel like you’ve traveled back to the USSR. Or, if you want to meet our Roma minority, then your way lies to the north of Moldova, to Soroca. The outskirts of the city might leave you with ambiguous feelings, but you will never forget this colorful trip and how you got to know such a unique group of people. And, of course, who could forget the mighty Codrii forests in the heart of the country. But if you do one thing when you come to see us, you should go to see the unique historical complex of Old Orhei. Seeing the cave monasteries and the ancient hermitage is a MUST. No visit to Moldova is complete without a trip to this picturesque valley, echoing with stories stretching back millennia.</p>
                                        <p>Immersive activities
Moldova’s beautiful outdoor landscape will inspire you to get active - so what do you feel like doing? You could raft down the river, go climbing, or rent some bikes and go for a ride. If you like hiking, you might be interested in our unique relict forest, Codrii, and one of the world’s longest caves, the "Emil Racovita Cave". Or if you have access to a car, you can find beautiful camp sites in Moldova’s most picturesque places. But our real treasure is our people. Get to know more about our traditions and folklore on special tours, where you can try local crafts and dip into the peculiarities of village life.</p>
                                        <p>And remember, small is beautiful, but also convenient: it doesn’t take long to travel to every corner of Moldova, so you can fully enjoy everything we have to offer.</p>
                                        <p>Safe, secure, and connected!
Whether it’s the middle of the day or night, you can go for a carefree walk in a city or a trip to the countryside, because Moldova is one of the safest countries in Europe. Moreover, cheap mobile internet is available throughout Moldova, and it’s fast: we’re in the top ten fastest countries for mobile internet in the world, alongside Japan and Latvia. You can always connect to free Wi-Fi in our cafes, trolleybuses, and even in our green and tranquil city parks,so you can stay in touch, and share your impressions of Moldova.</p>
                                        <p>Unique experiences to treasure forever
We have a full calendar of concerts, festivals, races and even a marathon. Every year, thousands of Moldovans participate in these events, so why not join them? In the autumn, come to the “Ethno Jazz” festival to hear folk and jazz musicians from around the world. In the summer, visit “DescOpera”, a three-day opera festival, to hear spine-tingling performances in an open-air amphitheater. In the depths of winter, head to our underground wine cellars for either music, at “Underland Fest”, or exercise, with the 10km Wine Run. Whatever you choose, the memories you make in Moldova will last a lifetime. To stay up to date with upcoming events in Moldova, and plan a trip to one of these events, subscribe to our newsletter. We will tell you everything you need to know about what’s coming up in our action-packed calendar. What are you waiting for? Be Our Guest!</p>
